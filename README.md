A simple python clone of the Monty Hall Problem. In this problem, the 
player is presented with three "doors". Behind one door is a prize, 
behind the other two doors, there is a 'goat' (not as cool as the 
prize). 

The player picks one door. Then, the player is shown one door that does 
not contain the prize. The player can then choose to switch to another 
unopened door, or stick with the original door they chose. 

Statistically, the player should always switch.
